## 1. makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## 2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
